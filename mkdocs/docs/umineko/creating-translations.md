# Creating Translations

In this tutorial, we will be talking about how you can create a new language setting for Umineko Project.

???+ info "Use your own language code!"
	In the tutorial, we used our own language code ==tr==, which is for Turkish. Don't forget to ^^use your own language code^^ instead.

	You can check [language codes :octicons-link-external-16:](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639_language_codes){:target="_blank"} page for other codes.
